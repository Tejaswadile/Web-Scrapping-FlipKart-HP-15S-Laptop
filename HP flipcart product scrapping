Vaibhav Bharati,4,Read carefully.. My Experience was complicated just because of boot time i.e. on/off time was too long until I didn't go for updates but once I have done all updates... I am telling you guys...Maska..hai.. Maska..Superb performance.. and look wise i liked it very much. I use to play GT racing without any lag..My daughter is also happy for her online studies.My suggestion is that don't think twice just go for it with Flipkart.Thanks flipkart for very safe and on time delivery.READ MORE,Very Good

Sayani  Banerjee ,5,Nice laptop and Ryzen 3 is a good processor for multi tasking... Design and color both are good. It's better to go with this HP laptop in this price segment...READ MORE,Worth every penny
Satyajit Swain,3,"This laptop needs to be upgraded to at least 8 gb memory for better performance as most of HP bloatware that comes with the windows build use almost 80% of ram all the time. Besides the built in vega gpu shares Ram as it does not have dedicated graphics memory. An SSD upgrade and booting the OS in there should do wonders to the disk I/O and overall performance. Out of the box, laptop is sluggish so 3 stars.READ MORE",Fair
